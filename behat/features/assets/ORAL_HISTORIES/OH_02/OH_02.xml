<pull_quote>Don Smith, who was in the history department in those days, particularly impressed me because he treated us—he took us seriously—he treated us as grown-ups. He didn’t expect us to be experts, but he treated us, not as peers or equals, but as historians, so to speak, who had an obligation to be honest and rigorous and scholarly and he had such a, sort of, gentle and gentleman-ly way of maintaining high standards that he made a tremendous impression on me. </pull_quote></extension></mods>
