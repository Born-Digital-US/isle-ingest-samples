  In order to prove the Drupal context is working properly
  As a developer
  I need to test some sample data

  @javascript
  Scenario: Viewing sample:1
    Given I am on "/islandora/object/samples%3A1"
    Then I should see "American Goldfinch (Audio)"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Viewing sample:2
    Given I am on "/islandora/object/samples%3A2"
    Then I should see a "body" element
    Then I should see "Worm-eating Warbler (Audio)"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Viewing sample:4
    Given I am on "/islandora/object/samples%3A4"
    Then I should see a "body" element
    Then I should see "Palm Tree type (Basic Image)"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Viewing sample:5
    Given I am on "/islandora/object/samples%3A5"
    Then I should see a "body" element
    Then I should see "Letter of note (Basic Image)"
